            <p>
              The University of Kelaniya's Faculty of Commerce and Management
              Studies is one of the quickly growing faculties with the potential
              to rank among the best in the nation because to its special
              qualities. The Department of Commerce was founded in 1976 as part
              of the Faculty of Social Sciences, which is where the Faculty had
              its start. In 1995, the department was transformed into the
              Faculty thanks to the dedication and tireless efforts of academic
              staff, students, and other stakeholders.
